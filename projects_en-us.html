          <h2 id="proj1">Creation of a Static Professional Profile Page</h2>
          <p>
            This project involved creating a static page to present my professional profile using AWS cloud infrastructure.
            Several technologies and services were used: Amazon S3 to host static files, CloudFront for content distribution with high availability and low latency,
            Route 53 for domain management and ACM (AWS Certificate Manager) for SSL/TLS security. Pages were built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript following web development best practices.
            Additionally, I used Artificial Intelligence during development to assist in code creation and to translate content into English,
            enabling a more global reach.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Technologies Used:</strong> AWS S3, CloudFront, Route 53, ACM, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, AI for development and translation.

          <h2 id="proj2">Integration of Azure Environment with Company Headquarters</h2>
          <p>
            In this project we interconnected the Azure environment with the company's headquarters using a Virtual Gateway for site-to-site VPNs with BGP in an active-active model, routing links through Barracuda firewalls and configuring link weights for contingency.
            A new AD DS instance with Windows Server 2025 was created in Azure and the service was added to the forest by raising the functional level. We migrated Entra ID Connect to the new AD DS instance and propagated Azure networks via BGP to partner datacenter networks,
            reaching our other cloud environment in GCP. On the AD server in Azure, we configured the Power BI Data Gateway so dataflows could access private endpoints such as databases, Samba shares, Trino, MongoDB and others.
            All VPN infrastructure was properly tagged and allocated into separate resource groups and connected via peering to the VPNs.
          </p>

            <h2 id="proj3">Automation and Monitoring of the Critical QlikView Environment</h2>
            <p>
                QlikView powered the company‚Äôs main products, accessed daily by external customers for critical business reports and dashboards.
                The infrastructure was based on a <strong>3-node Windows Server failover cluster</strong> connected to a <strong>shared storage</strong>.
                Although designed for high availability, this legacy environment presented several fragilities in practice.
            </p>
            <p>
                Main pain points included: manual maintenance processes, lengthy cluster and load balancing validations, difficulties restoring services after failures and limited monitoring that often only detected issues after customer complaints.
                This required on-call shifts (including weekends), making QlikView the weakest link and creating high unavailability risk for customers.
            </p>
            <p>
                Interim solutions such as manual checklists and isolated PowerShell/Bash scripts provided limited gains.
                The turning point was implementing an <strong>automation and monitoring ecosystem</strong> orchestrated by <strong>Rundeck</strong>, running on an Ubuntu server in GCP connected via Interconnect to datacenters and partners.
            </p>
            <p>
                The environment included scheduled and manual pipelines using multiple technologies: <strong>Bash</strong>, <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>PowerShell</strong>,
                <strong>Node.js with Puppeteer</strong>, and <strong>Ansible (playbooks and ad-hoc via SSH and WinRM)</strong>. Implemented automations included:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Monitored and forced reboots via iDRAC in case of failure.</li>
                <li>Automated movement of Cluster Shared Volumes (CSV) to maintain continuity.</li>
                <li>Service startup and validation after reboots.</li>
                <li>Integrity checks via QlikView Server health endpoints.</li>
                <li>Load balancing tests with synthetic traffic generated by Puppeteer.</li>
                <li>Chained error handlers to restart web services and recover clusters.</li>
                <li>Continuous monitoring in Python validating product loads and triggering alerts via email and Microsoft Teams.</li>
                <li>Recognition of known failures by hashing error screenshots and executing automatic fixes.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Additionally, a <strong>Rundeck credential vault</strong> was used to protect credentials and keys, and <strong>job-level variables</strong> were declared to promote code reuse and standardization.
                All scripts included timeouts, retries and fail-safe mechanisms.
            </p>
            <p>
                Job logs and statuses were integrated into Power BI Service data pipelines via Gateway, creating real-time failure and availability dashboards.
                Code was versioned in Azure DevOps with Markdown documentation for each job and script.
            </p>
            <p>
                The result was transformative: availability rose to <strong>99.997%</strong>, on-call duties were eliminated, and the team gained full predictability and visibility over the environment.
                The team could focus on strategic projects while the legacy QlikView environment ceased to be a critical bottleneck.
                The approach was later expanded to QlikSense servers with significant improvements as well.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Technologies Used:</strong> Rundeck, Ubuntu Server (GCP), Bash, Python, PowerShell, Node.js, Puppeteer, Ansible (SSH/WinRM), iDRAC, Power BI, Azure DevOps.

        <article class="section" aria-labelledby="proj4">
            <h2 id="proj4">Expansion of Automations for Corporate Environments and Services</h2>
            <p>
                Following the success of automating the legacy QlikView environment, we expanded the approach to other critical environments and services across the company.
                The <strong>Ubuntu server with Rundeck</strong> hosted in GCP and connected via Interconnect with <strong>BGP</strong> already had access to corporate environments,
                enabling centralization and standardization of automation execution.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first focus was <strong>monitoring SQL Server jobs</strong>, which frequently hung. Pipelines were created to validate job execution and, when a hang was detected, automatically apply fixes based on previously mapped errors.
                Corrections triggered email notifications and Teams alerts between IT Operations and Operations teams who were impacted by those specific job failures.
            </p>
            <p>
                Active monitoring of <strong>FTP and SFTP services</strong> was also implemented, including tests for access, upload, write and connectivity to identify issues before they impacted customers and partners.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another milestone was creating <strong>facilities jobs</strong> that automated day-to-day operational tasks previously done manually by interns or junior analysts.
                This avoided the need to grant critical access to portals like GCP, Cloudflare and internal DNS.
                Jobs required input variables, validated syntax and data coherence, and executed tasks in a controlled manner. Examples:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Automated download of files from GCP buckets.</li>
                <li>DNS registration in Cloudflare with propagation testing and evidence generation for tickets.</li>
                <li>Internal DNS registration with logs and audit trails.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                For security, <strong>execution ACLs based on AD profiles</strong> were applied. Users authenticated via LDAP only saw jobs permitted to their group and could execute them only if input data passed validation.
            </p>
            <p>
                The expansion also included <strong>integrated processes with Power BI Service</strong>: updating dataflows and datasets via Power Automate API, triggering pipeline steps automatically.
                Jobs for <strong>server data cleanup</strong>, <strong>automatic log backups to GCP buckets</strong> and many other automations reduced manual effort and increased operational reliability.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a result, the company evolved from manual and decentralized processes to a highly automated environment with standardization, security,
                traceability and scalability. Gains were not only in availability and response time but also cultural, establishing automation as a core operational pillar.
